## Project Restaurant Reviews_Stage 1 by Rasha Ali


### Specification

We have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Our job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### To view the website and see the changes I have made

1. Download the src code, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.  

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
3. Explore the website, and try it on different devices,try its accessibility and offline use.
